### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**stephenkamin/StephenKamin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I have created this based on the Adafruit Feather M4 Express, Adafruit FeatherWing OLED - 128x64 OLED Add-on For Feather and the Adafruit Sensirion SHT40 Temperature & Humidity Sensor.
https://www.adafruit.com/product/4885

In their advertising video they use the OLED to display Temp C and Relitive Humidty.
This file does 3 things...
1. it converts the C to F.
2. makes the text size larger (4 lines)
3. and adds F C and H to the display


- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I copy and paste - Ok I am addicted to it...
