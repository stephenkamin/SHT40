I have created this based on the Adafruit Feather M4 Express, Adafruit FeatherWing OLED - 128x64 OLED Add-on For Feather and the Adafruit Sensirion SHT40 Temperature & Humidity Sensor.
https://www.adafruit.com/product/4885

I did not code this , it is literaly the OLED and SHT40 example files pasted together.
I did write the TEMPF section and the C to F coversion

In their advertising video they use the OLED to display Temp C and Relitive Humidty.
This file does 3 things...
1. it converts the C to F.
2. makes the text size larger (4 lines)
3. and adds F C and H to the display


Fun fact: ... I copy and paste - Ok I am addicted to it...
